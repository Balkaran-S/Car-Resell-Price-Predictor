## About The Project
This Car Value Predictor aims to predict the price of a used Car by taking its Company name, its Model name, Year of Purchase, and other parameters. We take a data set of available car prices and using Linear Regression technique estimate the price of the car we have entered.

We also use Flask framework to convert it into a full-fledged website.

The goal of this project is to create an efficient and effective model that will be able to  predict the price of a used car by using the Linear Regression algorithm with better accuracy.
